"With the help of AI, colleges were assessed in three categories: Identity (historical and current affiliation, religious imagery and symbolism in visual identity and campus buildings, and school mission), Academics (religious studies offerings and requirements, and the learnings of the Religious Studies department, if any), and Culture (the presence of faith-based groups on campus, availability and diversity of chaplaincy, same-sex housing offerings and requirements; LGBT attitudes, codes of conduct formal religious affiliation; academic religious studies requirements; student policies such as discipline and honor codes; symbolism in school logos and architecture. Although a linear scale cannot fully capture these axes, it will be helpful as a starting point to understand which colleges are religiously oriented."



"0. Completely secular in history, mission, and culture."
"1. Completely secular mission and culture, but with religious roots and possible religious imagery still on campus and in the school's visual identity."
"2. Secular in mission and culture, no formal religious affiliation or only nominal ties, but with religious founders and faith-inspired values, perhaps a school motto with religious language, and active religious studies department. Typically socially and politically very liberal."
"3. Religiously affiliated but primarily secular in mission, with a liberal religious culture. Students of all faiths are welcome. School identity will usually be religious. Typically socially and politically liberal. LGBT-positive groups are typically encouraged and very active."
"4. Moderate religious identity and culture. There may be conservative elements in the leadership and academics, but critical religious studies will be available. School values are strongly religious, but there is usually a diversity of faiths among the student body. Religious studies are often required, but not doctrinal in nature. LGBT-positive groups are active, and sometimes even supported. Conservative political groups are likely to be active on campus, but not the majority."
5. Conservative religious identity and culture. Religious studies in a particular faith are usually required. These schools lean toward one particular faith and often profess a religious mission. Student body likely leans socially and politically conservative. Honor codes may invoke religious values. LGBT groups may have difficulty forming and achieving social acceptance.
"6. Primarily a religious institution that offers secular studies, or a school that exists to serve members of a particular faith. Religious studies are required, and faculty typically follow traditional doctrine. LGBT-positive groups generally not recognized, though may meet off-campus."
