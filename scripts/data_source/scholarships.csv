Empowering women in STEM

In keeping with MPOWER's commitment to empower high-potential global citizens to realize their educational aspirations – and become tomorrow's leading scientists and innovators – this international scholarship program focuses on women who will use their STEM degree to benefit society and the planet and who have the potential to serve as role models and advocates for women in STEM.

The National Center for Education Statistics reported that 32% of STEM degrees in the U.S. were awarded to women in one year. Women majoring in computer engineering, nuclear science and software development, amongst others, should not be challenged in funding their dream. In addition, the Society of Women Engineers found that gender inequities are especially pronounced in engineering and computer science, with just 20% of bachelor's degrees in engineering and computer science held by women.

For MPOWER CEO and Co-founder Manu Smadja, these statistics represent a social challenge to address. 

""It's critical for us as a society to have a meaningful representation of women shaping the science and technology of tomorrow,"" Smadja says. ""The world may look a lot different if we do a better job at enabling female talent to shape the technologies transforming healthcare, education, transportation or cities for instance. 

""By helping talented female students study and work in North America, we're helping close the gender gap in the STEM workforce. But we'd like to do much more, and starting this new scholarship program for women in STEM is yet another way to level the playing field.""
