            Lilliane Nguyen is an international student at the University of Rochester, pursuing a degree in Business. Like many international students, she has faced the weight of financial uncertainty and the often-unspoken gaps in support that accompany studying far from home.
          </p>
          <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.7', marginBottom: '20px', textShadow: '1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)' }}>
            LilGrant began as more than a project - it is a purpose-driven initiative shaped by lived experience.
          </p>
          <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.7', marginBottom: '20px', textShadow: '1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)' }}>
            Without access to federal grants, loans, or the full spectrum of aid available to domestic peers, international students frequently face a silent struggle - one that adds invisible pressure to an already demanding journey. LilGrant was created as a response to that challenge, born from a belief that no student should feel alone in the search for opportunity.
          </p>
          <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.7', marginBottom: '20px', textShadow: '1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)' }}>
            At its core, LilGrant is a platform designed to make scholarship discovery accessible, transparent, and empowering. It's a space built not just for finding funding, but for fostering hope - for helping students turn barriers into bridges.
          </p>
          <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.7', marginBottom: '20px', textShadow: '1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)' }}>
            Whether you're looking for financial assistance or simply need guidance in the maze of applications and deadlines, LilGrant is here to support you. Because your dreams are valid, your ambitions are powerful, and your journey deserves to be met with resources - not roadblocks.
